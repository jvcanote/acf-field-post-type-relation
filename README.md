# Advanced Custom Fields: Post Type Relation
Relative Post Type add-on for Advanced Custom Fields plug-in for WordPress

This add-on plug-in extends the ACF relationship model to include post types. Using this field adds a Post Type meta box to the post editor for the targeted post group. Selected post types can be considered children of the current post.

This works for situations where it was helpful to build hierarchy using post types. It was useful for archiving a group of different post types to a parent post type or page. In my case, the post types: Datasheet, White Paper, Webinar, Video, Example, and FAQ â€“ each with custom fields and templates, could be centrally archived in a "Resource" post type. This archive could be further filtered, allowing room to utilize all the features of WordPress Custom Post Types while simplifying and organizing the structure of your content by adding hierarchical relationships between post types.

This has not been thoroughly tested. The add-on has been working without fail for my use.
